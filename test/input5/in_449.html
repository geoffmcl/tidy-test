<h1>Issue #449 - 'as'</h1>
<p>Should this be included now?</p>
<p>ref: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/">preload</a>, which 
says 'W3C Working Draft 11 July 2016', and 'Implementers should be aware that this document is not stable.'</p>
<p>And althought the W3C validator passes this file, it say 'This tool is an ongoing experiment in better HTML checking, and its behavior remains subject to change'...</p>
<p>Is this the time to make this HTML Tidy change?</p>
