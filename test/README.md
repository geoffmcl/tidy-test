# Test Directory

Be aware this is a mish-mash of test html and batch files collected over the years.

Feel free to look around, but there is not a good explanation for everything here!

The `official` HTML Tidy tests are to be found [here](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5-tests). While it is still a WIP, it is a developing set of regression tests for Tidy.

There is some further explanations of specific tests in TESTS.md, but it is far from complete.
