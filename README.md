# tidy-test 20150610

Some simple test cases using a cmake FindTidy.cmake module.

1. test-tidy app

Acutally has the same functionality as classic tidy since it in fact uses the tidy.c from the HTACG tidy-html5 source.

2. test-opts app

First a test of setting a string option to a blank, and then running libtidy using own constructed memory allocator.

Enjoy.
